# Go language tutorials

Working my way through the tutorials for the Go language.

Go is a little different than what I'm used to, so the quality of this code is probably quite poor (for now, at least).

Can't say I'm crazy about some aspects of the syntax / formatting (e.g. spacing / newlines around struct braces seems to make it harder to visually differentiate between a struct type and its fields) but perhaps that's just lack of familiarity.
